## Overview

This footer project is designed to provide a visually appealing and functional footer for web pages. It includes sections for newsletter subscription, quick links, and technologies used. The design is modern, elegant, and fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.

### Challenges

Creating a fully responsive footer challenged me to consider different screen sizes and devices. I learned how to use Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes to adjust layout and styling based on screen width breakpoints. By implementing responsive design principles, I ensured that the footer looks great and functions properly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
